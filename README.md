# Plant Disease Detection App
This project is a small and easy-to-use web app made with Streamlit.
You can upload a picture of a plant leaf, and the app will tell you what disease it might have.
It also highlights the parts of the leaf that look infected.

# What the App Does
Lets you upload any leaf image
Shows the top 5 possible diseases with confidence percentages
Marks the diseased areas on the leaf
Has simple pages like Home, About, and Disease Recognition

# How It Works 
The app uses a trained deep learning model
The image is resized and given to the model
The model predicts the disease
OpenCV is used to find and show the infected spots on the leaf

# Why This Project?
This app helps farmers, students, and researchers quickly check plant health.
It makes early disease detection easier, which can help reduce crop loss and improve farming results.
